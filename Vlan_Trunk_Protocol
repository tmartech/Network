VTP use DTP.
If DTP is disabled, VTP can not work

3 modes
Server | Transparent | Client

Server = propagate vtp infos. (Conf saved in nvram)
Transparent = get nothing, propagate nothing. (Conf saved in nvram) version number is always 0.
Client = receive and propagate from a server. (Conf no saved in nvram)

If a switch is in transparent mode with no domain or a different domain than the vtp server, no vtp propagation will pass trhough the switch.

Tip : if you need to reset version number of vtp client 
1. switch to transparent then back to client.
2. change domain-name and revert.

Command :

vtp mode (SERVER|CLIENT|TRANSPARENT)
vtp domain XXX
vtm password XXX

// Show
show vtp status
show vtp password
